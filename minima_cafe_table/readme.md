# Minima café table

![minima table](img/IMG_20190313_184753.jpg)

Minima is a two persons table, based on traditional café table.
It has been designed to be fabricated using a CNC router with plywood 21mm thick.

The 3D file was designed with Rhinoceros 3D.
We used Autodesk Fusion 360 to generate the CNC toolpaths

## Building instructions

### CNC milling

The design is optimized to reduce use of wood

![minima table 2D](img/minima_cafe_21mm_2D.png)


We used [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview){:target="_blank"} to generate the toolpaths : you can find tutorials about the _Manufacture_ feature of Fusion 360 on [Autodesk website](https://f360ap.autodesk.com/courses#creating-toolpaths-and-programs-cam).

Use a 8mm flat milling bit to cut.
We included a [test sample](cnc_sample.3dm) to help you adjust your CNC toolpaths.

The [3D model](minima_cafe_21mm.3dm) includes the layout for CNC milling 1250x2500mm plywood panels. You can make 2 tables on one panel.
